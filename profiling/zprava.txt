We are profiling program with input of 10, 100 and 1000 numbers.
Output of profiling is in two-page pdf (vystup.pdf).

On the first page is profiling using cProfile. 
Most called function in all cases are our_add and our_pow from our_library. 

On the second page is visualization using pyinstrument (https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument).
Profiling interval is set to 0,0000001.
From picture of input 1000 numbers we can clearly see that the most time spent is on functions our_add and our_pow.
 
For optimization we must focus on these 2 functions and their calls in our program stddev.py. 
For example we can optimize the main function by not calculating the average of input numbers in start.
